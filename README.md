# SignalR-vue-client


Simple Vue.js component for web pages to add SignalR Core based interaction method.

This is a "newbie" Vue.js. So it needs lots of help. :)

 Just add this html snippet to your page, with additional .js and .css libraries.
 
 ```html
 <chat ref="box" access-key="xyx123455DKZeomcebBrIQAKKX54321"></chat>
```

History

- Simple login overlay mode is added. User have to enter a username to connect the SignalR Hub. Also some connection status can enable/disable overlay mode. For example; if any exception occurs in SignalR Hub or connection is closed, client should re-connect.
