# SignalR-vue-client


Simple Vue.js component for web pages to add SignalR Core based interaction method.

This is my first component with Vue.js. So it needs lots of help. Please feel free to make changes and help this repo. :)
 
 Just add this html snippet to your page, with additional .js and .css libraries.
 
 ```html
 <chat ref="box" access-key="xyx123455DKZeomcebBrIQAKKX54321"></chat>
